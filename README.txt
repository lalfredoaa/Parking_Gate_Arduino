Simple Arduino 1st semester project.

The goal of this project was to simulate a parking gate for a residential area, which could be controlled via WiFi. 

A servomotor was used to simulate the parking gate.
The gate was controlled via WiFi using an ESP8266 module and the Blynk app.
Some LEDs were added as well to indicate whether the gate was opened or closed.
